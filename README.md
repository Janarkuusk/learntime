# Project goal
Nowadays many kids do not know how to tell time correctly when they start first grade of school. They will miss their buses after school or they do not know when to return to class after lunchtime is over.It causes unwanted problems and stress to their parents. The aim of this project is to teach children how to tell time on a playful and fun way so they can use this knowledge in real life and manage their own time.
